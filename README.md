## About
A mock SPA (single page application) site for streaming videos. Demonstrating proficiency in React, React-Router, Node, Express, API's as well as other front-end essentials.

*NOTE: This app needs the [server](https://github.com/jpatel98/jigar-patel-brainflix-api) to run in parallel for full functionality.*

## Goals and Requirements

Goal was to build a full stack single page application using React, Express, and Node.js. 
I also used a [server](https://github.com/jpatel98/jigar-patel-brainflix-api) to obtain the video data, stream URL as well as the default comments. 

## Key Learnings

- Fully learned and implemented React fundamentals, including component lifecyle methods, using props and state as well as JSX.
- Utilized React-Router for declarative routing.
- Implemented the basics of Node.js and Express, created API endpoints in order to receive and return data.
- Used Semantic HTML, BEM methodoloy.
- Flexbox, SAAS, responsive and mobile-first design.
- Axios
